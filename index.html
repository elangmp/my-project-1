       <h2>BIG DREAM</h2>
       <h4>Become high skill web developer, hacker and electrical engineer</h4>
       <p> I used to dream of becoming a professional dota 2 player, but I couldn't because my skills were mediocre and I didn't have a team.</p>
       <p> After a while my dream turned into the number 1 hacker in the world who has a lot of money in a legal way. For example with the bug bounty.</p>
       <p> Then came the richest man in the world, namely: Elon Musk. I was inspired by him and wanted to be like him (even more).</p>
       <p> I really like technology, they are born from people who have extraordinary minds.</p>
